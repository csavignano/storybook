# Alert

The Alert component is widely used and provides several variations.

## Alert technical specs

* `icon` is an optional property allowing us to attach an icon as needed.
* `modifier` makes it possible to pass a CSS modifier class which in turn can change the button's appearance as you see the examples below.
* `text` is the label of the button.
* `url` is also an optional property which determines if we use a `<button>` or an `<a>` element based on the presence of the `url`.
